A small game of blackjack between you and 3 AI players

Gameplay
Each player is dealt 2 cards.

Each player's cards are revealed (except the dealer since they should only reveal one card)
The program will determine if any player has gotten 21 from the initial dela

If no one has gotten to 21, the user will be able to hit or stand. If they either hit 21 or bust, they will receive a message with the appropriate response.

If the user stands before hitting 21, then each AI player will begin their turn. The AI is very simple - the AI will keep hitting until they get to 16 or over. If they get over 21, they bust. If they get 21 exactly, they win.

Finally, the game will determine the highest score. If that score is the user's score, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
